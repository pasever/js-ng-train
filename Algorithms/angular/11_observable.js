/**
 An Observer is created that collects the events and distributes them to subscribers through an Observable.
 The simplest way to achieve this is to create a Subject, which provides both Observer and Observable functionality.
 The flow of events to a subscriber can be managed using a set of operators.
 **/

/**
 Observables are not streams. We can think of it as an API for tapping into a stream.
 We can use to define a stream, subscribe to it and transform it.
**/

/**
 Observable, represents an observable sequence of events. An object such as a component
 can subscribe to an Observable and receive a notification each time an event occurs, allowing it
 to respond only when the event has been observed instead of every time there is a change anywhere in the application.
