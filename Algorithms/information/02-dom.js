/**
    When the browser loads and processes the HTML document, it creates the Document Object Model (DOM)
    The DOM is a model in which JS objects are used to represent each element in the document.
    We rarely work directly with the DOM in Angular, but it is important to understand that the browser
    maintains a live model of the HTML document represented by JS objects.
